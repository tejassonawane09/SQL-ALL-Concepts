## ✅ How to Use This Repo (Best Way)

### 🔥 For Interview Preparation (Recommended Order)
1️⃣ Start from `01` to `06` (Strong base)  
2️⃣ Then do `07` to `10` (Advanced query skills)  
3️⃣ Then do `11` to `18` (Real-world DB concepts + optimization)  
4️⃣ Finally practice `SQL_Interview_Practical_Questions.md`

## 🧠 Best Practice Tips
- Write queries on **real sample datasets**
- Practice at least:
  - Joins + Group By
  - Subqueries vs Window Functions
  - Ranking problems (Top-N, 2nd highest, dept-wise)
- Use **EXPLAIN** to understand performance basics

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?
- Students preparing for SQL interviews  
- Entry-level Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles  
- Anyone who wants SQL notes in a clean structured way

---

## 📌 Next Updates (Optional)
- More interview problems (company-wise)
- Case-study SQL questions
- Advanced optimization examples
